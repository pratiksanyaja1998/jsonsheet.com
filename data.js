export const FAQS_LIST = [
    { que: 'Why should my company use Json Sheet?', ans: 'That`s an excellent question. Json Sheet is the new way to communicate for your entire company. It replaces email with something faster, better organized and more secure. Instead of one-by-one email chains, all your communications are organized into channels that are easy to create, join, and find. When you have one channel for everything that happens in your company, everyone knows exactly where to go to work.' },
    { que: 'How is Json Sheet different from spreadsheets?', ans: 'Json Sheet is a no-code platform that is as easy to use as a spreadsheet but works like a relational database. It`s completely customizable and entirely flexible for your teams to use. If you want to structure your data and are all over the place, you need a database. Often users struggle with spreadsheets to manage their workflows, as they are not meant to organize data.' },
    { que: 'What are the different no-code solutions we can create?', ans: 'We`ve seen JSON sheets used across industries - from book publishing to media production to startups to marketing agencies to real estate companies and more. Teams from 30+ unique industries have already built their own no-code solutions on Json Sheets.' },
    { que: "What is Json Sheet Connect?", ans: 'What is Json Sheet Connect? Json Sheet Connect is a more secure and productive way for organizations to communicate together. It lets you move all communications with your external partners, clients, vendors, and others into a Json Sheet, replacing email and promoting collaboration. Json Sheet extends enterprise-grade security features and compliance standards, such as enterprise key management, to Json Sheet Connect. Learn more about Json Sheet Connect.' }
